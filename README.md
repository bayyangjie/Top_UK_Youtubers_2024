# Objective 

Key pain point

- The Head of Marketing wants to find out who the top YouTubers are in 2024 to decide on which YouTubers would be best to run marketing campaigns throughout the rest of the year.

Optimal Solution

* To create a dashboard that provides insights into the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their 
- subscriber count
- total views
- total videos, and
- engagement metrics

This will help the marketing team make informed decisions about which YouTubers to collaborate with for their marketing campaigns.

## User story 

As the Head of Marketing, the user wants to have a dashboard that analyses YouTube channel data in the UK.

This dashboard should allow the user to identify the top performing channels based on metrics like subscriber base and average views. 

With this information, he/she can make more informed decisions about which Youtubers are right to collaborate with, and therefore maximize how effective each marketing campaign is.

# Data source 

To achieve the objective, the analysis would require data on the top UK YouTubers in 2024 such as their
- channel names
- total subscribers
- total views
- total videos uploaded

Source of data

- The data is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract), [see here to find it.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-100-social-media-influencers-2024-countrywise?resource=download)

# Stages

- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Analysis

# Design 

## Dashboard components required 
The following questions below can help to guide what the dashboard should contain

1. Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
2. Which 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?
3. Which 3 channels have the most views?
4. Which 3 channels have the highest average views per video?
5. Which 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
6. Which 3 channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?


## Tools 

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Excel | Exploring the data |
| SQL Server | Cleaning, testing, and analyzing the data |
| Power BI | Visualizing the data via interactive dashboards |
| GitHub | Hosting the project documentation and version control |


# Development

## Pseudocode

- What's the general approach in creating this solution from start to finish?

1. Get the data
2. Explore the data in Excel
3. Load the data into SQL Server
4. Clean the data with SQL
5. Test the data with SQL
6. Visualize the data in Power BI
7. Generate the findings based on the insights
8. Write the documentation
9. Publish the data to GitHub Pages

## Data exploration notes

This is the stage where we have a scan of what's in the data, errors, inconsistencies, bugs, weird and corrupted characters etc  


- Observations

1. There are at least 4 columns that contain the data we need for this analysis, which signals we have everything we need from the file without needing to contact the client for any more data. 
2. The first column contains the channel ID with what appears to be channel IDs, which are separated by a @ symbol - we need to extract the channel names from this.
3. Some of the cells and header names are in a different language - we need to confirm if these columns are needed, and if so, we need to address them.
4. We have more data than we need, so some of the columns would need to be removed


## Data cleaning 
- What do we expect the clean data to look like? (What should it contain? What constraints should we apply to it?)

The aim is to refine our dataset to ensure it is structured and ready for analysis. 

The cleaned data should meet the following criteria and constraints:

- Only relevant columns should be retained and renaming the columns that are kept.
- All data types should be appropriate for the contents of each column.
- No column should contain null values, indicating complete data for all records.

Below is a table outlining the constraints on the cleaned dataset:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Number of Rows | 100 |
| Number of Columns | 4 |

And here is a tabular representation of the expected schema for the clean data:

| Column Name | Data Type | Nullable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel_name | VARCHAR | NO |
| total_subscribers | INTEGER | NO |
| total_views | INTEGER | NO |
| total_videos | INTEGER | NO |

- What steps are needed to clean and shape the data into the desired format?

1. Remove unnecessary columns by only selecting the ones needed
2. Extract Youtube channel names from the first column
3. Rename columns using aliases


### Transform the data 

```sql
/*
# 1. Select the required columns
# 2. Extract the channel name from the 'NOMBRE' column
*/

-- 1.
SELECT
    SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS channel_name,  -- 2.
    total_subscribers,
    total_views,
    total_videos

FROM
    top_uk_youtubers_2024
```


### Create the SQL view

```sql
/*
# 1. Create a view to store the transformed data
# 2. Cast the extracted channel name as VARCHAR(100)
# 3. Select the required columns from the top_uk_youtubers_2024 SQL table 
*/

-- 1.
CREATE VIEW view_uk_youtubers_2024 AS

-- 2.
SELECT
	CAST(SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS VARCHAR(100)) as channel_name,  /* '-1' is to exclude the @ symbol from the extracted substring */
	total_subscribers,
	total_views,
	total_videos

-- 3.
FROM
	top_uk_youtubers_2024
```


# Testing 

Below are the data quality checks performed 

## Row count check

```sql
/*
# Count the total number of records (or rows) are in the SQL view
*/

SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS no_of_rows
FROM
    view_uk_youtubers_2024;

```

### Notes

For this analysis, the priority is analyzing the expected ROI (net profit) for the marketing client based on three different metrics such as the YouTube channels with the most 

- subscribers
- total views
- videos uploaded


## Net Profit Calculation and Validation

A campaign is ran based on each of the measurement metrics mentioned above (i.e Youtube channels with the most subscribers, total views, videos uploaded). The net profits of the top three Youtube channels within each metric are then calculated. 

For each campaign, certain figures are fixed. For example, the product cost which refers to the price of the product placed in the video advertisement, the conversion rate which refers to the rate at which views are converted to products sold and the campaign cost.

The profit calculations are performed in both excel and SQL to validate the figures obtained. 

### 1. Youtubers with the most subscribers 

#### Calculation breakdown

**Campaign idea = product placement** 

1. NoCopyrightSounds 

- Average views per video = 6.05 million
- Product cost = $5
- Potential units sold per video = 6.05 million x 2% conversion rate = 121,000 units sold
- Potential revenue per video = 121,000 x $5 = $605,000
- Campaign cost (one-time fee) = $50,000
- **Net profit = $605,000 - $50,000 = $555,000**

2. DanTDM

- Average views per video = 5.37 million
- Product cost = $5
- Potential units sold per video = 5.37 million x 2% conversion rate = 107,400 units sold

- Campaign cost (one-time fee) = $50,000
- **Net profit = $537,000 - $50,000 = $487,000**

3. Dan Rhodes

- Average views per video = 11.40 million
- Product cost = $5
- Potential units sold per video = 11.40 million x 2% conversion rate = 228,000 units sold

## Discovery

What was discovered

1. NoCopyRightSounds, Dan Rhodes and DanTDM are the channels with the most subscribers in the UK
2. Boomerang UK, More Emily and Sing King are the channels with the most uploaded videos
3. DanTDM, DanRhodes and Mister Max are the channels with the most views

# Recommendations

1. NoCopyrightSounds is the best Youtube channel to collaborate with to maximize visibility because it has the most number of subscribers in the UK.
2. In terms of most active channels with regular video publishing, GRM Daily, Manchester City and Yogcasts are the most active. However, it is worth considering whether collaboration with these channels are worth it because of their negative ROI.
3. Mister Max may be the best Youtube channel to maximize reach given that it has the highest average views per video. However, collaborating with DanTDM and DanRhodes may be better long term options since they have larger subscriber bases and are also having significantly high number of views on their channels.
4. DanTDM, DanRhodes and NoCopyRightSounds are the three best channels to do collaboration with due to the high engagement rate (viewership/subscriber base) on their channels.

# Potential ROI

1. Setting up a collaboration deal with Dan Rhodes on the campaign of Product Placement yields the highest net profit of $1,065,000 per video.
2. An Influence Marketing campaign with Mister Max would yield a net profit of $1,255,000 per video.
3. A product placement campaign with DanTDM could generate the client approximately $487,000 per video. If we advance with an influencer marketing campaign deal instead, this would make the client a one-off net profit of $407,000.
4. A product placement campaign with NoCopyRightSounds can return a net profit of $555,000 per video which is worth considering as well.

# Action plan

Based on the overall analysis, the best channel to create a long term partnership with for promoting the client's products is the Dan Rhodes channel. Other channels that can be considered would be the MisterMax, NoCopyRightSounds and DanTDM. 

Steps to be taken with the selected channels:
1. Reach out to the teams behind each of the selected channels, starting with Dan Rhodes
2. Negotiate contracts within the budgets allocated to each marketing campaign
3. Kick off the campaigns with the selected channels and track the campaigns' performances against the KPIs
4. Review how the campaigns have gone, gather insights and optimize based on feedback from converted customers and each channel's audiences (e.g Profile of audiences, Advertisement reach, Engagement metrics like Click-Through-Rate and View-Through-Rate)
